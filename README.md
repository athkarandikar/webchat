### About
- Chat applications generate large amounts of data every day. Every user sends a lot of textual data over the network. Nowadays, people talk more online than in-person. The online world has evolved very rapidly, and is growing exponentially, and will keep growing in the future. There is currently a lot of hatred and violence in society, which disturbs personal physical and mental state.  
- At present, no chat application provides the feature of sentiment analysis.  
- Using Webchat's sentiment analysis, the user can interpret how he sounds like to the person he is talking to, and try to correct himself if he realizes that he was talking in a manner that he was not supposed to. This would allow people to become individuals with a good behavior, and ultimately bring love and peace in society.  
- For example, if you send a message ‘I am angry with you!’, the app will show that you are angry with the receiver using emojis.  
- Webchat uses textual data to learn and predict the sentiment or mood of the user.
